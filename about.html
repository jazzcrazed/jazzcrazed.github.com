  <p>I&rsquo;m Marco Carag, a Brooklyn-based web developer.</p>

  <p>
    I&rsquo;m the lead front-end developer for dating startup
    <a href="http://www.howaboutwe.com">HowAboutWe.com</a> in
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbo,_Brooklyn">DUMBO</a>. I get to
    work with a spectacular team of of brilliant and talented people &mdash;
    developers and otherwise &mdash; and I&rsquo;m grateful for it.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also organize a couple meetups:
    <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Brooklyn-Javascript">BK.js</a>, a monthly
    meetup about all things JavaScript held at various venues in Brooklyn, and
    <a href="http://www.bklyn.gd">BKLYN Green Drinks</a>, a social networking
    meetup for folks in the area interested in sustainability and environmentalism.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have a degree in Communications Design from <a href="http://www.pratt.edu">
    Pratt Institute</a>, and have lived nearby the school in
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Hill,_Brooklyn">Clinton Hill</a>
    for twelve years. The past few years have been with my beautiful fiance&#233;
    and <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/101625155591132408533/albums/5627200706857952081">
    two awesome, though sometimes troublesome, cats</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    When not coding (which is often) or not hanging out with my fiance&#233;
    (which is rarely), I enjoy playing video games, listening to or performing
    Latin music, and
    <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/101625155591132408533/albums/profile/5627140138224237458">

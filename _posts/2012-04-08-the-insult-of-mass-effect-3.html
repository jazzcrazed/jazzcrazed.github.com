title: "My Massive Nitpick of Mass Effect 3"
description: 
  Being a big fan of the first two games, I anticipated
  <a href="http://masseffect.com">Mass Effect 3</a> about as much as the whole
  of the gaming world did. Despite being a relatively fun experience, navigating
  around its fictional universe betrays a real lack of experience in interface
  design. What follows is a long, nerdy nitpick of it.

<p>
  For those who are new to the series, Mass Effect is a trilogy of
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_role-playing_game">action RPGs</a>
  following the exploits of Commander Shepard as (s)he attempts to save sentient
  life across the galaxy from an ancient (prehistoric, from a human perspective)
  robotic race called the Reapers. It&rsquo;s a
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_opera">space opera</a> with immense
  production values, setting a high bar with graphics, acting, and cinematic
  atmosphere &mdash; all the more impressive being a game with a branching
  storyline and a variety of possible outcomes. But the third game never quite
  escapes the confines of its mechanics to tell its story compellingly, making
  the melodrama fall flat.
</p>

<p>
  One of its failings is in navigating the fictional Milky Way it&rsquo;s
  created, which plays a major role in the core gameplay mechanics. The game
  formula distills to this: After acquiring a mission, either along the
  main storyline via cinematics or as side quests acquired from assorted
  non-player characters, the player travels to the planet or space station
  where the mission takes place using a navigation computer on the bridge of
  Shepard&rsquo;s ship, the
  <a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Normandy_SR-2">Normandy SR-2</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Getting to destinations means entering a map view and moving a little
  toy-like representation of your ship, around a hugely out of scale
  representation of star systems and the galaxy as a whole. This is a moronic
  way to navigate. In today&rsquo;s day and age, we send our spaceships
  about the solar system programmatically. Thanks to a solid understanding of
  orbital mechanics, we knew, for example, when and where
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon)">Titan</a> would be in July
  of 2004 nearly seven years in advance. In 1997, we programmed
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens">Cassini-Huygens</a>
  with some telemetry, aimed, fired, and pretty much forgot &mdash; at least in
  the sense of necessary real-time navigation.
</p>

<p>
  Mass Effect takes place in our distant future, long after Huygens poked around
  the surface of Titan. Not only have we fully mapped our Solar System, but
  we&rsquo;ve clearly well-mapped dozens of other solar systems across the Milky
  Way. Going to Planet X in Star System Y should be a matter of picking its name
  from a car-GPS-like list (including autocompletion), and then you&rsquo;re
  there. Instead, it&rsquo;s a matter of panning a cursor around arbitrary nodes
  in a toy Milky Way until the name you want shows up in a popup &mdash; stupid
  already because now I need to hunt for the desired star system. At least
  printed maps have the advantage of <em>always showing the names of streets and
  places all of the time</em>.
</p>

<p>
  The next big problem with this view is that there&rsquo;s no way to
  zoom the map in or, more importantly, out. This sucks, because the galaxy map
  doesn&rsquo;t even fit in a single screen. You have to pan your cursor around
  to see the edges, where there are indeed things worth paying attention to.
  It&rsquo;s a painful victory of form over function, as the vast majority
  of the Milky Way is just empty, lovely, celestial texture that clearly could
  have been condensed down into something usable. As annoying as this is here,
  it&rsquo;s actually a lot worse in other views, which I&rsquo;ll get to next.
</p>

<p>
  Once you&rsquo;ve found the desired system, you enter it with a push of a
  button, and then you&rsquo;re plunged (after a lovely but repetitive
  &ldquo;jump&rdquo; cinematic) into an even sillier &ldquo;zoom level&rdquo;
  &mdash; a map of the individual solar system where the &ldquo;mass relay&rdquo;
  that facilitates faster-than-light travel is orbiting. Various space errata
  in the forms of planets, moons, asteroids, and other junk are scattered around
  this view. Planets get the added distinction of having their orbital cycle
  mapped with a circular line around the center star(s); though, it&rsquo;s
  clearly just for looks, since nothing ever progresses along its orbit (despite
  the game timeline taking weeks or more).
</p>

<p>
  This is the view where you navigate by pushing your little toy ship around.
  And, like its bigger galaxy-spanning brother view, <em>nothing</em> is
  labelled by default. To figure out the name of a planet, station, or other
  orbiting thing, you have to &ldquo;fly&rdquo; your toy Normandy to it. Dumb,
  because obviously the data is there &mdash; why force you to push a toy over
  it to get that info?
</p>

<p>
  This is made worse by the fact that the toy Normandy for no good reason at all
  has significant mass, and thus gradual acceleration and momentum. Not because
  you&rsquo;re flying through space, mind you, since there&rsquo;s drag. More as
  if you had an actual toy on a tabletop that you were nudging around. You can
  guess how precise this mode of information gathering actually is; a lot of
  nudging and re-nudging just to &ldquo;hover&rdquo; in the right spot.
</p>

<p>
  And that&rsquo;s not the end &mdash; or even the worst &mdash; of it. Often times,
  there&rsquo;s more than one star system nearby that must be <em>nudged</em>
  to, since there wasn&rsquo;t the convenience of a mass relay to get there
  directly. This is basically a third view that&rsquo;s similar to the individual
  star system view, except much, much harder to read. Other star systems are
  points of light on an already incredibly bright celestial texture background.
  I suppose it wouldn&rsquo;t be proper space opera without some
  fractal-addict&rsquo;s glowy nebula wallpaper. But when it makes things
  harder to read&hellip;?
</p>

<p> 
  So you get around this view with the same toy nudging. Except, here, on a
  much larger cosmological scale (though, not as large by a long shot as the
  galactic view where you navigate with a vastly simpler cursor), you naturally
  have to accelerate your toy to a much higher speed. So, your little toy
  accelerates and decelerates much slower than in the smaller scale system view
  that came before.
</p>

<p>
  To make things more complicated, your toy <em>consumes fuel</em> in this view.
  Traveling between stars costs fuel, but not between planets&hellip;you know,
  just because. And thanks to the heftier momentum your toy harbors at this
  scale, it&rsquo;s even less precise &mdash; in the physics of Mass Effect,
  it&rsquo;s easier to miss the gravity well of a freaking star than it is a
  planet. Also, according to ME physics, you have an actual top speed beyond
  which you can&rsquo;t accelerate. And sadly, you can&rsquo;t cut off your
  acceleration and just coast the rest of the way, taking full advantage of
  Newton&rsquo;s laws and not spending fuel, like all real world spacecraft do.
  Because, of course, this is a little toy being nudged around on a glowy table.
</p>

<p>
  The cost of fuel is actually trivialized in the game, since money is easy to
  come by (the economy of end-of-times deserves deserves its own nitpicking).
  But the fact that the Normandy has a limited capacity of fuel, you have to be
  judicious with your tabletop nudging. In the end, it&rsquo;s clearly a poorly
  thought out mechanic that tacks on inconvenience to an already inconvenient
  interstellar navigation system.
</p>

<p>
  There are ways to do this whole interface right &mdash; I&rsquo;d very much
  consider it a solved problem. Take <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google
  Maps</a>, for instance, which lets you *gasp* text search for what you want,
  or zoom and pan to find what you want. Or, if you really want to reproduce
  the feel of hurtling between planets in a map view, take a good gander at 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Control_II">Star Control II</a>
  by <a href="http://www.toysforbob.com/">Toys For Bob</a>, which came out
  <em>twenty years ago</em> and did it with aplomb.
</p>

<p>
  This was really one of many (an RPG with no inventory view? Why do all npcs,
  alien or not, look like they&rsquo;re in their late 20s?) extremely nerdy
  nitpicks I have about Mass Effect 3 that nicked away at the illusion. Oh, I
  know it&rsquo;s pretty obsessive, but for all of the production value,
  movie-quality television advertising, and massive marketing blitz, it&rsquo;s
  also hard to dismiss. I hope the next time Bioware decides to sink a year and
  millions of dollars into a project, it really makes sure the end result is
  completely fleshed out.

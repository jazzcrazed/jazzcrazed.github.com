title: "Back Again, with Jekyll"
description: "The fact that it&rsquo;s been a year and a half since my last post
  clearly evidences that blogging might not be the thing for me. Call me a glutton
  for punishment, but I&rsquo;ve decided to return to it, and this time the tools
  I&rsquo;m using are a large part of that -- namely, <a href='http://jekyllbootstrap.com'>
  Jekyll Bootstrap</a> and <a href='http://github.com'>GitHub</a>."

  Obviously, I&rsquo;ve been pretty busy over the past couple of years. To start,
  I got a new job in late 2010 &mdash; a month after my last post &mdash; with a
  dating startup named <a href="http://www.howaboutwe.com">HowAboutWe</a>.
  It&rsquo;s been an incredible experience so far that comes with many firsts:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    It&rsquo;s my first time working with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">
    Ruby on Rails</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    It&rsquo;s my first time using <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> regularly
    as an editor. (As opposed to using it quickly to change config files and such.)
  </li>
  <li>
    It&rsquo;s my first time working with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>
    and <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    It&rsquo;s my first time using compiled stylesheets via <a href="http://compass-style.org">
    Compass</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a>.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  These and a host of others came as a big shock to my system after years of working
  at <a href="http://microsoft.com/net">.NET</a> shops. Perhaps the biggest shock wasn&rsquo;t simply how different this
  experience has been, but really how much I absolutely <em>love</em> the workflow.
  I&rsquo;d been satisfactorily productive using Microsoft Visual Studio in Windows
  2003 and Team Foundation Server. But getting a Github repo going, coding for
  a bit in Vim, committing, pushing &mdash; doing it daily here feels practically
  second nature to me. (Not to mention the addition of automated testing to my life.)
</p>

<p>
  For a very long while now, I&rsquo;ve been wanting to come back to this blog
  to document all of this change &mdash; and in general, get back into blogging.
  But I couldn&rsquo;t get myself to return to it in its then-current form. To start,
  I desperately wanted to redesign it. Which I began to do by getting a new 
  <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> theme going for my existing
  blog install.
</p>

<p>
  But I realized quickly that the blog itself, its implementation and my use of it
  are as much a part of the document than the post content. I also realized
  that, quite frankly, if I wanted to maintain a decently regular posting
  schedule, then I should probably incorporate the workflows that are most
  productive to me.
</p>

<p>
  At work, we&rsquo;ve talked a lot for a while about the value of server-generated pages
  rather than static HTML files for certain components. For instance, we used to
  have ad modules that would make crazy queries to conjure seemingly timely
  and location-relevant 300x250s that would live on third-party websites.
  This was nuts for a couple of reasons &mdash; namely, that trusting user-generated
  content for the purpose of brand advertising is an extremely risky proposition,
  but also the queries were not trivial, and despite caching the hit on our servers
  was substantial (the ads themselves usually ran on ad-supported content sites that often see
  tons and tons more hits than we do, such as <a href="http://nymag.com">New York Magazine</a>.
  In this case, it made complete sense to curate the content, and just serve up quick
  and fast static HTML that would be cached practically to infinity. A day later,
  we replaced nearly all of these ads with the static content, and the elegance of the
  solution had big payoffs in both performance, and code maintenance (a new style
  of ad just means a new HTML file).
</p>

<p>
  Blogs were another area that we&rsquo;ve talked about a lot as websites that
  extremely rarely change enough to necessitate being dynamically generated on
  the server. Instead, it seems to make more sense to move the CMS offline,
  have the pages generated and compiled once after each update, and then upload
  the resulting HTML &mdash; the results being super fast

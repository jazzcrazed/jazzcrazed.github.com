title: "Back Again, with Jekyll"
description: "The fact that it&rsquo;s been a year and a half since my last post
  clearly evidences that blogging might not be the thing for me. Call me a glutton
  for punishment, but I&rsquo;ve decided to return to it, and this time the tools
  I&rsquo;m using are a large part of that -- namely, <a href='http://jekyllbootstrap.com'>
  Jekyll Bootstrap</a> and <a href='http://github.com'>GitHub</a>."

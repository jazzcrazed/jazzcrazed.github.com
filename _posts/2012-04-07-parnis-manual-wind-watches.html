title: "Parnis Pilot&rsquo;s Watch"
description:
  Parnis is a Chinese mechanical watch maker specializing in homages to popular
  styles. The ones that drew my attention are their &ldquo;pilot&rdquo;-styled
  hand-winding watches. I just recently got one &mdash; unbranded, with the
  seconds subdial at the 9-o-clock &mdash; and it&rsquo;s pretty great.

  I love mechanical watches. Despite being significantly less accurate than
  pretty much every other watch technology since the 1950s (like quartz),
  there&rsquo;s something beautiful and elegant in the tiny gears and springs of
  mechanical movements, which also never need batteries.
</p>

<p>
  My first mechanical watch is an automatic: a Hamilton Khaki Navy GMT that
  uses a Swiss-made self-winding movement. When I sought to add another watch
  to the collection, I figured a manual winding watch would be more convenient
  since I wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about wearing it every day (or investing
  in an electric winder, which for mechanical watches seems a bit of a silly
  idea) just to keep it wound.
</p>

<p>
  I&rsquo;m drawn to pilot watches because of the legibility of the dial, which
  traditionally are large black and black and sported heavy white sans-serif
  numerals &mdash; originally designed to be readable in the poor lighting of World
  War-II era aircraft, and to be worn over thick bomber jackets. The end result
  has been an extremely readable design that persists today. In making my rounds
  of watch forums and blogs, I came across Chinese watchmakers like Parnis
  making beautiful classically styled watches for cheap.

<p>
  This is actually my second Chinese hand-wound watch. I previously owned a
  Garton pilot watch that I also really loved. But one day, I made the poor
  decision of letting it get near-soaking wet. The dial casement popped off not
  long after, and then the movement just plain stopped working. I could have
  gotten it repaired, but it would have costed better than 50% of the original
  sub-$100 cost.

<p>
  I learned a few things from the Garton about hand-wound watches. Firstly,
  that winding the big, solitary crown of a hand-wound movement is kind of
  therapeutic to me. I rarely let it wind down to a stop. Second, these pilot
  watches are so readable, and so much lighter than the Hamilton (which, to be
  fair, is all stainless steel) that I ended up wearing them more frequently
  than the Hamilton. Third, the Garton had excellent lume that kept it readable
  even through a movie. It didn&rsquo;t take very long before I yearned to
  replace it.

  Finally, months after it broke, I ordered this 44mm Parnis pilot watch
  from Manbushijie.com, which forums heavily endorsed as one of the most
  reliable Chinese watch sources. In about three weeks, I had received it.

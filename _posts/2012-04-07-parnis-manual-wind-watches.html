title: "Parnis Pilot&rsquo;s Watch"
description:
  I love manual hand-wound watches.
  Parnis is a Chinese mechanical watch maker specializing in
  homages to popular styles. The ones that drew my attention are their
  &ldquo;pilot&rdquo;-styled hand-winding watches. I just recently got one &mdash;
  unbranded, with the seconds subdial at the 9-o-clock &mdash; and it&rsquo;s
  pretty great.

  This is actually my second Chinese hand-wound watch. I previously owned a
  Garton pilot watch (probably using the exact same Unitas 6497 clone movement)
  that I also really loved. But one day, I made the poor decision of letting it
  get near-soaking wet. The dial casement popped off not long after, and then
  the movement just plain stopped working. I could have gotten it repaired, but
  it would have costed better than 50% of the original sub-$100 cost.

  I was drawn to pilot watches because of the legibility of the dial, which
  traditionally uses heavy white sans-serif numerals on black dials, with
  generous luminous paint applied. And I was drawn to hand-wound movements
  because I wouldn&rsquo;t be wearing it regularly, and I appreciated the
  simplicity of being able to pick it up, set the time, and wind it whenever
  I was in the mood to wear it.

  Months after my Garton broke, I finally ordered this 44mm Parnis pilot watch
  from Manbushijie.com, which according to forums like

  It turns out I like winding big-crown watches. It&rsquo;s remotely
  therapeutic to me, like tapping my fingers when I&rsquo;m stuck in thought.
  So I rarely let the power spring run out just from habitual winding.

  Being a big fan of the first two games, I anticipated
  <a href="http://masseffect.com">Mass Effect 3</a> about as much as the whole
  of the gaming world did. I just beat it a couple of weeks ago, and it left
  a somewhat unsatisfying taste in my mouth.
</p>

<p>
  For those who are new to the series, Mass Effect is a trilogy of
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_role-playing_game">action RPGs</a>
  following the exploits of Commander Shepard as he attempts to save sentient
  life across the galaxy from an ancient robotic race called the Reapers. It&rsquo;s
  a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_opera">space opera</a>
  with immense production values, setting a high bar with graphics, acting,
  and cinematic atmosphere &mdash; all the more impressive being a game with
  a branching storyline and a variety of possible outcomes. But the third game
  never quite escapes the confines of its mechanic to tell its story compellingly,
  making the melodrama fall flat.
</p>

<p>
  Most of the problem, I feel, lies in its attempts to flesh out a realistic
  world and galaxy, and not quite hitting the mark. Suspending disbelief is a
  huge challenge in games, but there are some sore spots in Mass Effect 3 that
  could have been avoided simply by not being there.
</p>

<h2>Homogeneity in Gaming Worlds</h2>

<p>
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world">Open world</a> game design
  has been big in the gaming industry for years now, since computing power has
  improved enough to accommodate its complexities. The trick to an open world
  game is that it shouldn&rsquo;t feel like a chore to travel through parts of
  the world that are irrelevant to game progress in order to get to parts that
  are relevant.
</p>

<p>
  A common way about this is to pepper the game world with side quests that add
  relevance to the irrelevance. The Mass Effect games tack this way, with mixed
  results. In Mass Effect 3, you encounter side quests mostly by wandering through
  the game world, overhearing side conversations, and listening through to their
  end. Unfortunately, without variety, this can quickly feel more like a chore
  than a nice (if not completely necessary to progress) atmospheric detail &mdash;
  &ldquo;grindy&rdquo; in RPG parlance.
</p>

<p>
  The process in almost every single case goes like this: you run your character
  around for several uneventful minutes, waiting for a voice way louder than the
  background din (and/or for a voice that is accompanied by subtitles, if you
  have them on) to come within earshot. Then, you stand there, waiting, paying
  attention to the details of the conversation or not, until the telltale UI
  cue pops up indicating that a quest has been added to your mission log.
</p>

<p>
  The first problem comes in the unrealism of the situation. I understand the
  need to easily be able to pick these quests out from just the normal noise
  of the game world. But having it be the sole voice in a crowd of interacting
  but muted non-player characters is kind of a cop-out. There may as well just
  have been a flag waving over the relevant characters&rsquo; heads. Or, just
  remove all the surrounding muted, dumb, prop npcs. The conceit is betrayed
  by the contrast between the relevant and irrelevant, and more time should
  have been spent in making the quest acquisition more subtle.
</p>

<p>
  The second part of the problem comes with the quests themselves. They are
  &ldquo;fetch quests&rdquo; for which the resolution is to get in your spaceship,
  fly around the galaxy, find the necessary object, and return it to the same npc
  that you overheard needs it.
</p>

<p>
  Flying around Mass Effect 3 means entering a map view and moving a little
  toy-like representation of your ship, the
  <a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Normandy_SR-2">Normandy SR-2</a>,
  around a hugely out of scale representation of star systems and the galaxy
  as a whole. To start, this is a moronic way to navigate. In today&rsquo;s
  day and age, we send our spaceships about the solar system programmatically.
  Thanks to a solid understanding of orbital mechanics, we knew, for example,
  when and where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon)">Titan</a>
  would be in July of 2004 nearly seven years in advance. We programmed
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens">Cassini-Huygens</a>
  with some telemetry, aimed, fired, and pretty much forgot &mdash; at least in
  the sense of necessary real-time navigation.
</p>

<p>
  Mass Effect takes place in our distant future, long after Huygens poked around
  the surface of Titan. Not only have we fully mapped our Solar System, but
  we&rsquo;ve clearly well-mapped dozens of other solar systems across the Milky
  Way. Going to Planet X in Star System Y should be a matter of picking its name
  from a car-GPS-like computer (autocompletion of form inputs included), and then
  you&rsquo;re there. Instead, it&rsquo;s a matter of moving a cursor around
  arbitrary nodes in a toy Milky Way until the name you want shows up in a
  popup &mdash; stupid already because now I need to hunt for the desired star
  system. At least printed maps have the advantage of <em>always showing the
  names of streets and places all of the time</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Once you&rsquo;ve found the desired system, you enter it with a push of a
  button, and then you&rsquo;re plunged (after a pretty but repetitive
  &ldquo;jump&rdquo; cinematic) into an even sillier &ldquo;zoom level&rdquo;
  &mdash; a map of the individual solar system where the &ldquo;mass relay&lrdquo;
  that facilitates faster-than-light travel is orbiting. Various space errata
  in the forms of planets, moons, asteroids, and other junk are scattered around
  this view; planets get the added distinction of having their orbital cycle
  mapped with a circular line around the star in the center.
</p>

<p>
  This is the view where you navigate by pushing your little toy ship around.
  The first problem is that this view is <em>not zoomable</em> &mdash; which in
  itself is only a problem because most systems can&rsquo;t even fit within a
  single screen. The second problem is that

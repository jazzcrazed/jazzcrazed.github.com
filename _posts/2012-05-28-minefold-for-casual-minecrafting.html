  Like millions of others in the world, I&rsquo;m a big fan of the block-moving
  timesink, <a href="http://minecraft.net">Minecraft</a>. Not long
  after my curiosity was piqued by a random video of someone burning down their
  pixellated home, I bought a license while the game was still in Alpha, and
  have moved countless blocks since.
</p>

<p>
  But what&rsquo;s given it such lasting appeal to me wasn&rsquo;t just the
  unique spontaneity of its endless worlds, or the dumbfounding creativity
  spawned of its emergent gameplay. It was the fact that its vast worlds
  persisted, and that, being the setter of my own rules, I could consume it at
  my leisure. It was something I could add to when I felt like it.
